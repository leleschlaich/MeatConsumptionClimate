          <!-- <h2>Why do we need to keep an eye on Climate Change?</h2> -->

          <p>
            Since the UN Climate Change Conference in 2010, efforts have been
            made to limit global warming caused by greenhouse gases to only two
            degrees Celsius by the end of the century compared to the
            pre-industrial age. In the Paris Agreement of 2015, two degrees
            remains the goal, but the aim is to limit warming to only 1.5
            degrees. Human activities have so far led to a global temperature 
            increase of 1.0 degrees Celsius.
            <br />
            If no drastic measures will soon be taken, the temperature could
            already rise by 1.5 to 7.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the
            century, depending on the scenario.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the earth warms up by more than two degrees, 
            researchers believe that drastic and irreversible
            environmental changes will occur – heatwaves, droughts, floods,
            natural disasters and the extinction of species.
            <img src="../assets/images/climatechange_Zeichenfläche 1.svg"width="100%" />
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Decisive action by all countries is required, 
            as global emissions of greenhouse gases must be drastically 
            reduced: In order not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, 
            CO2 emissions must be reduced by at least 40 percent by 
            2030 compared to 2010 levels. By 2050, we have to be climate neutral.
          </p>
          <p>
            And each of us can contribute to achieving this goal by reducing our
            personal C02 emissions.

          <h2> In short: intensive
            animal husbandry leads to CO2 emissions.</h2> 
          

          <p>
            The whole thing is a concatenation of many factors. Animals need a
            lot of food until they reach slaughterable age. The forage crops in
            turn need soil to grow. These soils are originally pastureland and
            are converted into arable land by clearing. In the process, carbon
            in form of CO2 is released into the air. Fertilizers are used to
            make the plants grow faster. These chemicals consist among other
            things of animal excrements and can produce emissions in the form of
            laughing gas. This may happen if the fertilizer is not used
            carefully. Some animal species even produce emissions in the form of
            methane directly by excreting it themselves, thus polluting the
            environment.<br />
            Did you know that methane is 25 times more harmful and nitrous oxide
            350 times more harmful than CO2?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="../assets/images/methane-01.svg"width="100%" />
          </p>
         
          <p>
            Furthermore, the stables of the animals need energy to be heated or
            lit and the meat has to be processed. Depending on the type of electricity 
            (green electricity or not) this point is more climate-friendly or 
            more harmful. Another factor
            that is relevant when it comes to CO2 emissions is the transport of
            animals, meat and animal products. These are released into the air
            in the form of exhaust gases.
            <br/>
            <br/>

          </p>
          <p>
            The rainforest also has a particularly important function here. It
            is also called the green lung of the planet and has a great
            influence on the global climate. It ensures that CO2 is converted
            into oxygen through photosynthesis. However, if more and more
            rainforest is cleared for fodder cultivation and animal grazing, it
            can decompose less CO2 and more CO2 rises into the atmosphere that
            was previously bound in the forests. So, you see, it all adds up to
            a lot...

            Did you know that one kilogram of beef consumes almost 15,500 liters
            of water? That is as much as 250 five-minute showers<br /><br />
            The production of one kilogram of beef produces 60kg of methane. To
            compare: 60 kg is the weight of 274 Mc Donald’s Big Macs.<br /><br />
            Did you know that the edible proportion of beef in Germany is only
            37% of 100%? This is about the same as if you bake a cake, cut it
            into 8 equal pieces and throw 5 of them away.<br /><br />
            Did you know that 1 kg of beef, when produced outside the EU,
            requires the equivalent of 49 square meters of space? That is as
            much as a typical 1 room apartment in Germany. Only for 1 kilogram
            of beef instead of one person.<br /><br />
            In addition to meat, one must of course not forget that dairy
            products such as butter, cheese, curd cheese and milk also come from
            animals and therefore have a large CO2 impact. They are no less
            problematic compared meat.<br /><br />
            90 percent of the fresh meat in Germany comes from livestock farms.
            A cow with over 220 kilograms has only 1.8 square meters to live.
            This is only the space of when you walk two steps forward and one to
            the side.<br /><br />
            Did you know that not all regions are climate-friendly? Because feed
            that is often produced overseas and then transported to various
            farms around the world. So, it is possible that meat from
            Argentinean cattle, which live exclusively on pastureland, has a
            better ecological balance sheet than regional beef from cattle that
            are only in the barn and that are fattened with concentrated feed
            from overseas.<br /><br />
            Did you know that meat from the region does not automatically have a
            better CO2 footprint? It is not the distance from the production
            site and point of sale that is decisive, but the size of the company
            and the efficiency with which it operates. Because even in our
            region our animals eat what is produced overseas and then
            transported to various farms around the world.
